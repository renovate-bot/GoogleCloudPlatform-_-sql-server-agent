# Agent for SQL Server

[![Build](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/sql-server-agent/actions/workflows/go.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/sql-server-agent/actions)

⚠️ **Deprecation Notice** ⚠️

This project is now considered **deprecated** and will no longer receive active
development.

**Reason for Deprecation:**

This library has been superseded by the official `Google Cloud Agent for Compute
Workloads` (https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/workloadagent), which offers
improved performance, more features, and ongoing
support from the core team.

**What this means for you:**

* **No new features:** We will no longer be adding new features or enhancements to Agent for SQL Server.
* **Limited bug fixes:** While we will address critical security vulnerabilities, general bug fixes will be minimal and prioritized based on severity.
* **Security Vulnerability Patching:** We commit to patching critical and
high-severity security vulnerabilities in this repository until
**December 31, 2025**. After this date, no further security updates will be
provided.
* **No further releases:** There will be no new major or minor releases.
* **Community support only:** Future support will primarily come from the
community. We encourage users to help each other through GitHub Issues, but our
team will not be actively monitoring or responding to general support requests.
* **Archiving (planned):** After **March 31, 2026**, we plan to archive this repository, making it read-only.

**What should you do?**

* **Transition to an alternative:** We strongly recommend that users begin transitioning to `Google Cloud Agent for Compute Workloads` as soon as possible.
* **Fork the repository:** If you wish to continue maintaining or developing
Agent for SQL Server for your own purposes, you are welcome to fork this
repository. However, note that we will not be accepting pull requests
from forks after the deprecation date.
* **Review existing issues:** If you have open issues, please consider whether they are still relevant given the deprecation.

**Thank you:**

We would like to thank all contributors and users for their support over the
years.
